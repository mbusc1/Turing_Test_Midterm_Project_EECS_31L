Errors encountered
-------------------------------------------------
Syntax errors in carrygen, flaggen, asel1 and asel2 
	--- was using equivalence operator (==)  in if statement to assign 
Not using "." when calling modules
Could not check a range in a conditional statement 
	--- fixed by creating a generate statement to parse through the range
	--- used a local variable to eventually assign 
Referenced mux incorrectly 
	--- referenced mux_21 rather than the correct, mux2to1
Result and cout are undefined in 1bit ALU 
	--- defined
sending flaggen carryout rather than carry[DWIDTH]
syntax error: A[127:0] vs. [127:0]B
	---A[127:0]
128bit ALU: carry was an output 
	--- turned carry into an input
Multiple Concurrent Drivers
	--- carrygen -- changed all else ends to the same number 
		-- if one if failed, the value changed and that value was passed onto the next if causing problems
	--- asel1
